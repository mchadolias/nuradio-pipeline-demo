### Example: Effective Volume Calculation (from NuRadioMC)

This folder has been copied over from the `NuRadioMC` [project](https://pypi.org/project/NuRadioMC/). This code originates from the [NuRadioMC Github repository](https://github.com/nu-radio/NuRadioMC).

This example demonstrates how to use the NuRadioMC package to generate the effective volume of a radio neutrino detector.

Guidelines for running this example are already available in the [NuRadioMC documentation](https://nu-radio.github.io/NuRadioMC/main.html).

Please note that this code is included here for usage purposes in the preparation of an interview task and it has been slightly only modifed for the inclusion of a Snakemake pipeline.
